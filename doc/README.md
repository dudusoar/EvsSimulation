# Documentation Directory

This directory maintains project memory and task progress to avoid re-analyzing the entire codebase each time.

## Document Structure

### ðŸ“‹ Core Documents
- **`PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`** - Project goals, architecture, and components
- **`CURRENT_STATUS.md`** - Implementation status and completed features  
- **`TASK_ROADMAP.md`** - Development tasks and priorities
- **`TECHNICAL_NOTES.md`** - Design decisions and technical considerations

## Usage Guidelines

### When Starting Work
1. Read `CURRENT_STATUS.md` to understand what's done
2. Check `TASK_ROADMAP.md` for next priorities
3. Reference `TECHNICAL_NOTES.md` for implementation details

### After Completing Tasks
1. Update `CURRENT_STATUS.md` with new completed features
2. Mark completed tasks in `TASK_ROADMAP.md`
3. Add new technical insights to `TECHNICAL_NOTES.md`

### Principle
Keep documentation simple and practical.

Only add new documents when absolutely necessary. Update existing ones instead.
